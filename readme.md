# Law And Order Order

## Dev

You need a folder `data/videos/` with video files sorted into season sub directories to run.

```
docker pull sklise/lawandorder
script/dev
```

## TODO

- fine tune threshold
- check ocr result for the desired place cards
- determine if the cards have a predictable format.
- remove end credits :(
- save synopsis etc into json?
